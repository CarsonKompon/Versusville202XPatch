#Wasteball instruction
MENU_INSTRUCTIONS_TITLE=INSTRUCTIONS
MENU_INSTRUCTIONS_WASTEBALL=Welcome to the Wasteball Arena! This is the most violent and desirable competition in Versusville, and YOU have been chosen to join the fight!\n\nIn the arena, fire your chemical paintball weapons to increase the other players' contamination levels, and once they reach critical, they will vaporize and you'll bag the points! But be warned - they're out to get you too!\n\nReduce your contamination levels by entering the Decontamination Showers around the arena, but watch out - these can be sabotaged with the Waste Vial Launcher and vaporize you instead!\n\nLook out for Chemical Waste Puddles on the ground and the Mutants around the battlefield - they'll attack on sight!\n\nAre you a survivor or a sucker?
MENU_INSTRUCTIONS_CEMETERY=The Losers' Cemetery...an eerie and sinister place, and where you'll end up if you don't do the Grave Rave!\n\nThe dead walk tonight, but only for a few short feet before their rotten carcasses explode everywhere! Using your Guts Gun, scoop up what remains and hurl it at your opponents.\n\nUse the Launch Meter to see how far the flesh will fly! Sticky Ectoplasm left by the resident ghosts can also be launched to paralyze your foes.\n\nZombies, brains, guts, guns...just a normal night in Versusville!
MENU_INSTRUCTIONS_RESIDENCE_PRIMARY=So, you wanna live in Versusville, don't cha, rookie? You think you've got what it takes? Your rite of passage begins here, in Versusville's resident house of horrors!\n\nYour mission is simple: Find a way to unlock the elusive Vault Door located within. But keep your eyes peeled - Kenny and Spenny don't take well to newbies, especially ones like you!\n\nFortunately, Kenny's lack of cleanliness has afforded you the upper hand in disarming the Traps that line the halls. Launch Blue and Brown Pills with your Slingshot to send Kenny and Spenny into a deep sleep or a colon cleansing, and snag whatever household items you can find to disarm and destroy their defenses.\n\nGood luck...you're gonna need it.
MENU_INSTRUCTIONS_RESIDENCE_SECONDARY=So, you wanna live in Versusville, don't cha, rookie? You think you've got what it takes? Your rite of passage begins here, in Versusville's resident house of horrors!\n\nYour mission is simple: Find a way to unlock the elusive Vault Door located within. But keep your eyes peeled - Kenny and Spenny don't take well to newbies, especially ones like you!\n\nFortunately, Kenny's lack of cleanliness has afforded you the upper hand in disarming the Traps that line the halls. Launch Blue and Brown Pills with your Slingshot to send Kenny and Spenny into a deep sleep or a colon cleansing, and snag whatever household items you can find to disarm and destroy their defenses.\n\nGood luck...you're gonna need it.
MENU_INSTRUCTIONS_MARKET=Welcome to the Versus Market, where insane racers go wild in the aisles! Careen your Kart through the market and be the first to cross the finish line, through fair means or foul.\n\nMaintain your lead to gain more points, and use them to arm Traps around the track to sabotage your opponents. Stay sharp - those sales may be tempting, but there's no mercy in such market mayhem!\n\nIt's always good to be first in line, or soon enough, you'll be working the graveyard shift...
